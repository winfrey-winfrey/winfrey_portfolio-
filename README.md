Winfrey's Portfolio

# Introduction

Hey there! I am Makoba Winfrey Nabumoni. A beginner software developer. This is my portfolio and it is intended to show you what I am able to do so far and will also serve as a means to start this journey with you until I am better.

## Table of contents

This portfolio contains the following contents.
It has a navigation bar that houses my education background, interests, languages, and contact information.
It also has the hero section that houses the hero statement and the button to download my curriculum vitae.
It also has the about me section that gives a brief description of who I am and who I hope to become.

## Description

The navigation bar for this particular purpose talks about the things i have studied before i enrolled for this course. It also shows my interests, especially in this particular journey of software development and the languages that i am studying both at PLP and on a personal level as well as my contact information.

However, for the Curriculum vitae download button, the Curriculum vitae cannot be accessed and that is something I am studying to rectify in the near future. It also does not include any projects I have done this being my first project.

Please join me on this journey as I grow in this field and may it be fun for us all!
